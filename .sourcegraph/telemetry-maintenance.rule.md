Check that event recording is updated correctly after logical changes:

- If the code path that leads to a telemetryRecorder.recordEvent() call (or similar calls, depending on the language) has changed, ensure that the event is still recorded correctly, or update the names of the event's feature and/or action to reflect the change.
- If an event is no longer needed, remove it.
- If an event is now only recorded under certain conditions, ensure that the conditions are correct, that the event's feature and/or action are correct, or that another event is also recorded under other conditions.
