"I'll create a simple Hello World function in Java for you.

\`\`\`java:src/HelloWorld.java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        sayHello();
    }

    public static void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
\`\`\`

To compile and run this Java program, you can use these commands:

\`\`\`bash
javac src/HelloWorld.java
\`\`\`

\`\`\`bash
java -cp src HelloWorld
\`\`\`

This creates a clean and simple Hello World program with a dedicated function to print the greeting. The program uses a separate \`sayHello()\` method which demonstrates good practice for function organization. Feel free to modify the message or add more functionality!"
