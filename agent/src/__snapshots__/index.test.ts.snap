"I'll create a simple Hello World function in Java. Here's a clean and straightforward implementation:

\`\`\`java:src/HelloWorld.java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        sayHello();
    }
}
\`\`\`

To compile and run this program, you can use these commands:

\`\`\`bash
javac src/HelloWorld.java
\`\`\`

\`\`\`bash
java -cp src HelloWorld
\`\`\`

This Java program includes:
- A dedicated \`sayHello()\` function that prints the greeting
- A \`main()\` method that calls our function
- Clean, standard Java naming conventions
- A simple and reusable structure

Feel free to use this as a starting point for more complex Java programs!"
