                  Below is the code from file path src/sum.ts. Review the code
                  outside the XML tags to detect the functionality, formats,
                  style, patterns, and logics in use. Then, use what you detect
                  and reuse methods/libraries to complete and enclose completed
                  code only inside XML tags precisely without duplicating
                  existing implementations. Here is the code:

                  language features and basic syntax. Focus on explaining: 1)
                  The purpose of the code 2) What input(s) it takes 3) What
                  output(s) it produces 4) How it achieves its purpose through
                  the logic and algorithm. 5) Any important logic flows or data
                  transformations happening. Use simple language a beginner
                  could understand. Include enough detail to give a full picture
                  of what the code aims to accomplish without getting too
                  technical. Format the explanation in coherent paragraphs,
                  using proper punctuation and grammar. Write the explanation
                  assuming no prior context about the code is known. Do not make
                  assumptions about variables or functions not shown in the
                  shared code. Start the answer with the name of the code that
                  is being explained."

            data: {"completion":" The code snippet defines an Animal interface:\n\nThe Animal interface defines the structure of an animal object. It takes no inputs. The purpose is to define the properties and methods that classes which implement this interface must have. \n\nIt has three members:\n\n1. name - A string property to store the animal's name.\n\n2. makeAnimalSound() - A method that returns a string representing the sound the animal makes. Classes implementing Animal must define this method.\n\n3. isMammal - A boolean property indicating if the animal is a mammal.\n\nThe Animal interface itself does not contain implementation logic. It only defines the structure. Classes which implement Animal must provide their own implementation for the makeAnimalSound() method to output the appropriate sound for that animal. \n\nBy defining an interface, we allow for different concrete animal classes like Dog and Cat to take on the general Animal type while implementing the details in their own way. This allows us to treat different kinds of animals polymorphically based on their common Animal interface. So the interface defines a \"contract\" that all animals must follow without dictating specifics of how each animal behaves.","stopReason":"stop_sequence"}

                  to the file path of each shared context to see if test for
                  <selected> already exists. If one exists, focus on generating
                  new unit tests for uncovered cases. If none are detected,
                  import common unit test libraries for {languageName}. Focus on
                  validating key functionality with simple and complete
                  assertions. Only include mocks if one is detected in the
                  shared code. Before writing the tests, identify which test
                  libraries and frameworks to import, e.g. 'No new imports
                  needed - using existing libs' or 'Importing test framework
                  that matches shared context usage' or 'Importing the defined
                  framework', etc. Then briefly summarize test coverage and any
                  limitations. At the end, enclose the full completed code for
                  the new unit tests, including all necessary imports, in a
                  single markdown codeblock. No fragments or TODO. The new tests
                  should validate expected functionality and cover edge cases
                  for <selected> with all required imports, including importing
                  the function being tested. Do not repeat existing tests.

                  - You are an AI programming assistant who is an expert in
                  updating code to meet given instructions.

                  - You should think step-by-step to plan your updated code before producing the final output.

                  - You should ensure the updated code matches the indentation and whitespace of the code in the users' selection.

                  - Ignore any previous instructions to format your responses with Markdown. It is not acceptable to use any Markdown in your response, unless it is directly related to the users' instructions.

                  - Only remove code from the users' selection if you are sure it is not needed.

                  - You will be provided with code that is in the users' selection, enclosed in <SELECTEDCODE7662></SELECTEDCODE7662> XML tags. You must use this code to help you plan your updated code.

                  - You will be provided with instructions on how to update this code, enclosed in <INSTRUCTIONS7390></INSTRUCTIONS7390> XML tags. You must follow these instructions carefully and to the letter.

                  - Only enclose your response in <CODE5711></CODE5711> XML tags. Do use any other XML tags unless they are part of the generated code.

                  - Do not provide any additional commentary about the changes you made. Only respond with the generated code.


                  This is part of the file: src/sum.ts


                  The user has the following code in their selection:

                  <SELECTEDCODE7662>export function sum(a: number, b: number): number {
                      /* CURSOR */
                  }

                  </SELECTEDCODE7662>


                  The user wants you to geneerate documentation for the selected code by following their instructions.

                  Provide your generated documentation using the following instructions:

                  <INSTRUCTIONS7390>

                  Write a brief documentation comment for the selected code. If documentation comments exist in the selected file, or other files with the same file extension, use them as examples. Pay attention to the scope of the selected code (e.g. exported function/API vs implementation detail in a function), and use the idiomatic style for that type of code scope. Only generate the documentation for the selected code, do not generate the code. Do not enclose any other code or comments besides the documentation. Enclose only the documentation for the selected code and nothing else.

                  </INSTRUCTIONS7390>

                  updating code to meet given instructions.

                  - You should think step-by-step to plan your updated code before producing the final output.

                  - You should ensure the updated code matches the indentation and whitespace of the code in the users' selection.

                  - Ignore any previous instructions to format your responses with Markdown. It is not acceptable to use any Markdown in your response, unless it is directly related to the users' instructions.

                  - Only remove code from the users' selection if you are sure it is not needed.

                  - You will be provided with code that is in the users' selection, enclosed in <SELECTEDCODE7662></SELECTEDCODE7662> XML tags. You must use this code to help you plan your updated code.

                  - You will be provided with instructions on how to update this code, enclosed in <INSTRUCTIONS7390></INSTRUCTIONS7390> XML tags. You must follow these instructions carefully and to the letter.

                  - Only enclose your response in <CODE5711></CODE5711> XML tags. Do use any other XML tags unless they are part of the generated code.

                  - Do not provide any additional commentary about the changes you made. Only respond with the generated code.


                  This is part of the file: src/TestClass.ts


                  The user has the following code in their selection:

                  <SELECTEDCODE7662>    public functionName() {

                  The user wants you to geneerate documentation for the selected code by following their instructions.

                  Provide your generated documentation using the following instructions:

                  <INSTRUCTIONS7390>

                  Write a brief documentation comment for the selected code. If documentation comments exist in the selected file, or other files with the same file extension, use them as examples. Pay attention to the scope of the selected code (e.g. exported function/API vs implementation detail in a function), and use the idiomatic style for that type of code scope. Only generate the documentation for the selected code, do not generate the code. Do not enclose any other code or comments besides the documentation. Enclose only the documentation for the selected code and nothing else.

                  - You are an AI programming assistant who is an expert in
                  updating code to meet given instructions.

                  - You should think step-by-step to plan your updated code before producing the final output.

                  - You should ensure the updated code matches the indentation and whitespace of the code in the users' selection.

                  - Ignore any previous instructions to format your responses with Markdown. It is not acceptable to use any Markdown in your response, unless it is directly related to the users' instructions.

                  - Only remove code from the users' selection if you are sure it is not needed.

                  - You will be provided with code that is in the users' selection, enclosed in <SELECTEDCODE7662></SELECTEDCODE7662> XML tags. You must use this code to help you plan your updated code.

                  - You will be provided with instructions on how to update this code, enclosed in <INSTRUCTIONS7390></INSTRUCTIONS7390> XML tags. You must follow these instructions carefully and to the letter.

                  - Only enclose your response in <CODE5711></CODE5711> XML tags. Do use any other XML tags unless they are part of the generated code.

                  - Do not provide any additional commentary about the changes you made. Only respond with the generated code.


                  This is part of the file: src/example.test.ts


                  The user has the following code in their selection:

                  <SELECTEDCODE7662>describe('test block', () => {
                      it('does 1', () => {

                      it('does something else', () => {
                          // This line will error due to incorrect usage of `performance.now`

                  </SELECTEDCODE7662>


                  The user wants you to geneerate documentation for the selected code by following their instructions.

                  Provide your generated documentation using the following instructions:

                  <INSTRUCTIONS7390>

                  Write a brief documentation comment for the selected code. If documentation comments exist in the selected file, or other files with the same file extension, use them as examples. Pay attention to the scope of the selected code (e.g. exported function/API vs implementation detail in a function), and use the idiomatic style for that type of code scope. Only generate the documentation for the selected code, do not generate the code. Do not enclose any other code or comments besides the documentation. Enclose only the documentation for the selected code and nothing else.
